# IdoYourQuotes — Electrical Workspace Build Brief
**For use in new build chats alongside the codebase zip. Do not feed SESSION-START.md into electrical build chats — use this file only.**

---

## 1. What We Are Building

A completely separate frontend workspace for the electrical sector. The goal is full end-to-end workflow: upload drawings → symbol takeoff → QDS with labour auto-calculation → quote generation → PDF tender submission document.

This is **not a modification of QuoteWorkspace.tsx**. It is a new set of files that share only the server infrastructure (tRPC routes, DB, billing, auth, R2 storage).

---

## 2. New Files Being Created

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `client/src/pages/ElectricalWorkspace.tsx` | Main workspace page for electrical sector |
| `client/src/components/electrical/ElectricalQDS.tsx` | Electrical-specific QDS component |
| `client/src/components/electrical/ElectricalTakeoffPanel.tsx` | Symbol counts, measurements, editable takeoff |
| `client/src/components/electrical/ElectricalPDF.tsx` | Electrical PDF template (phases, timelines, plant hire, labour) |
| `server/engines/electricalEngine.ts` | Server-side electrical AI engine (Tier 3) |
| `server/data/electricalLabourRates.ts` | Spon's UK labour rate lookup table |

**Files that must NOT be modified:**
- `QuoteWorkspace.tsx` — untouched
- `QuoteDraftSummary.tsx` — untouched
- `routers.ts` — only add new routes, never modify existing ones
- `db.ts` — only add new queries if needed
- `pdfGenerator.ts` — add electrical template as a new function, do not modify existing `generateSimpleQuoteHTML`

---

## 3. Routing Rule

In the quote routing component, detect sector and render the correct workspace:

```typescript
if (quote.sector === 'electrical') {
  return <ElectricalWorkspace quoteId={quoteId} />;
}
return <QuoteWorkspace quoteId={quoteId} />;
```

The sector field already exists on the quotes table. No schema changes needed for routing.

---

## 4. UI Layout — Fixed Height, Single Scroll

**Critical:** The current general workspace has three competing scrollbars. The electrical workspace must be built with a fixed-height layout from day one.

### Layout Rules
- Workspace is a **fixed viewport layout** — outer page does not scroll while in the workspace
- Left sidebar (drawing list): fixed height, scrolls independently within its own column
- Main content area: takes remaining width and height, scrolls within itself only
- No nested scroll contexts competing with each other
- Only one scrollbar visible at any time

### Tab Structure
1. **Inputs** — Upload drawings, optional symbol legend PDF, paste email/text scope
2. **Takeoff** — Per-drawing symbol review table, measurements, scope toggles
3. **QDS** — Quantities + labour auto-calculated from Spon's reference + plant hire
4. **Quote** — Line items, totals, phases, timelines
5. **PDF** — Tender submission document

---

## 5. Input Rules

- Drawings upload: multiple PDFs, processed one by one
- Legend/symbol key: **single dedicated upload slot**, labelled "Upload Symbol Legend (optional)" — visually distinct from drawing upload zone
- Legend can also be embedded in a drawing — the AI detects and uses it either way
- **Job-level legend memory**: once a legend is uploaded or defined, it applies to ALL drawings on that job. Never uploaded twice
- Paste email/text field: drives scope inclusion/exclusion — AI reads this to know what to include/exclude
- All inputs survive re-analysis — nothing the user has edited is ever destroyed

---

## 6. Legend Handling — Three Scenarios

The AI must always try to resolve symbols automatically before involving the user.

### Scenario A — Legend embedded on drawing
AI reads the legend from the drawing page, builds complete symbol map, counts everything. No questions asked.

### Scenario B — Legend uploaded as separate PDF
AI reads the legend upload slot first, builds symbol map, processes all drawings against it. Applies to all drawings on the job.

### Scenario C — No legend found
AI asks **once** per job:

> *"I've analysed this drawing but couldn't find a symbol legend. You can upload a legend PDF using the legend slot above, or I can show you the symbols I found and you can describe them below."*

Two options: upload legend (AI re-processes automatically) or define manually (symbol review table with blank descriptions). Never asks again after this.

---

## 7. Takeoff Panel — Symbol Review Table (Not a Question Flow)

**Replace the current per-symbol question drip entirely.**

### Review Table Structure

| Toggle | Symbol Code | AI Description | Count | Unit | Measurement | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✓ | A1 | IP65 LED Recessed Downlight | 24 | each | — | Matched |
| ✓ | B1 | IP65 Wall Mounted LED Bulkhead | 8 | each | — | Matched |
| ✓ | HOB | 32A DP Switch Serving Hob | 2 | each | — | Matched |
| ⚠ | FAP | Fire Alarm Panel Isolator | 2 | each | — | Review |
| ✗ | CD | — | 5 | — | — | Excluded |

### Column Behaviours
- **Toggle**: green = include, grey = exclude. User clicks to toggle
- **AI Description**: editable inline — user corrects any wrong match
- **Count**: editable — user corrects AI count
- **Measurement**: editable — for linear/area items (cable tray lengths, trunking runs)
- **Status**: Matched / Review (amber, AI uncertain) / Excluded (user toggled or auto-excluded)

### What the AI Does Automatically
1. Reads legend first (embedded, uploaded, or job-level memory)
2. Matches every symbol to legend — pre-fills all descriptions
3. Flags uncertain matches as Review in amber
4. Auto-excludes title block annotations, engineer initials, revision markers — never asks the user about these
5. Only truly unresolvable symbols appear with blank descriptions

### Per-Drawing Grouping
Left sidebar lists drawings. Selecting one shows its symbol review table. Counts are per-drawing and aggregated in QDS.

---

## 8. QDS Behaviour

### Core Rules
- QDS built from confirmed takeoff — never re-runs takeoff automatically
- **Re-analysis NEVER destroys user edits:**
  - `plantHire` array preserved (captured before parse, injected back)
  - `assumptions` and `exclusions` only written on first generation
  - User-edited quantities, prices, labour hours preserved via `takeoffOverrides`
- QDS manually editable at all times

### Labour Auto-Calculation
When a symbol/item is confirmed in takeoff:
1. Match item description to Spon's UK reference data (Section 10)
2. Multiply hours/unit by quantity, or hours/metre by measurement
3. Apply productivity multiplier (user selects — see Section 10)
4. Apply user's labour rate from settings (default £60/hr)
5. Show as editable field — user overrides any value

### QDS Sections for Electrical
- **Line Items** — fittings, accessories, devices (per symbol, per fitting)
- **Containment** — cable tray/trunking by metre, with fittings
- **Cabling** — by metre and type
- **First Points** — circuits × first point charge (user-entered rate)
- **Plant / Hire** — daily/weekly with buy-in/sell/profit auto-calc
- **Preliminaries** — accommodation, welfare, travel
- **Labour Summary** — auto-totalled
- **Sundries** — allowance per fitting

---

## 9. PDF Output for Electrical

Formal tender submission document:

- Cover page: project name, reference, date, tender submission
- Project description and scope
- **Phases and timeline** — derived from total labour hours: first fix → second fix → testing → commissioning. User edits in QDS before generating
- Line item breakdown by discipline (only sections with items)
- Plant hire breakdown with buy-in / sell / profit
- Labour summary
- Exclusions and assumptions
- Terms and conditions

---

## 10. Labour Reference Data — UK Spon's (Authentic)

**Source:** Spon's Construction Resource Handbook (Bryan Spain, E&FN Spon / Taylor & Francis), verified against Spon's M&E Services Price Book 2024. Grade: LQ (Qualified Electrician). These are authentic UK figures — they supersede all previous Durand Associates (US) data.

Stored in `server/data/electricalLabourRates.ts` as a typed lookup table.

## 11. Key Architectural Guardrails

- **Sector agnosticism** — ElectricalEngine dispatched by `engineRouter.ts`. Changes cannot affect other engines
- **No duplication** — use existing tRPC routes. Never create parallel versions
- **plantHire protection** — implemented in QuoteWorkspace.tsx. Must be in ElectricalWorkspace.tsx from day one
- **QDS edit preservation** — capture user state before AI call, inject back. Apply to ALL editable fields
- **No measurements hardcoded** — every drawing measured fresh from its own scale
- **AI includes everything** — never silently drops symbols
- **Legend memory is job-level** — one upload covers all drawings
- **Single question per job** — if no legend found, ask once only

---

## 12. Build Order (Phases)

**Phase 1 — Routing split**
Detect electrical sector, render ElectricalWorkspace skeleton with fixed-height layout. Deploy and verify routing.

**Phase 2 — Workspace shell**
Tab structure, drawing upload zone, legend upload slot (visually distinct), paste email/text. Fixed-height layout fully implemented.

**Phase 3 — Takeoff Panel**
Symbol review table (not question flow). Three legend scenarios. Job-level legend memory. Per-drawing grouping. Greyed-out toggles, editable counts and measurements. Title block annotations auto-excluded.

**Phase 4 — ElectricalQDS + Drawing Viewer** ✅ COMPLETE
All QDS sections built. Labour auto-calculation using Spon's UK rates with productivity multiplier. plantHire and full re-analysis edit preservation. View Marked Drawing restored with full marker editing.

**Phase 5 — electricalEngine.ts** ✅ COMPLETE
Server-side AI engine. Two exports: (1) `ElectricalEngine` class — `parseDictationSummary` routes here for `tradePreset === "electrical"`. Reads `ELECTRICAL TAKEOFF` blocks from `processedContent`, aggregates counts across drawings, applies Spon's M&E 2024 rates, returns `EngineOutput`. (2) `generateElectricalLineItems(qds, startSortIdx)` — called by `generateDraft` when `qdsSummaryJson._type === "electrical"`. Converts QDS rows to supply items, splits total labour into Phase 1/2/3 (40/40/20%), adds programme note, firstPoints, plantHire, preliminaries, sundries allowance.

**Phase 6 — Electrical PDF** ✅ COMPLETE
Tender submission format with phases, timelines, plant hire, labour summary.

---

## 13. Shared Infrastructure Reference

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Save/load quote | `trpc.quotes.updateQuote`, `trpc.quotes.getFull` |
| Line items | `trpc.lineItems.*` |
| Assumptions/exclusions | `trpc.tenderContext.upsert` |
| Catalog | `trpc.catalog.*` |
| File upload | existing R2 upload routes |
| Recalculate totals | `recalculateQuoteTotals` in db.ts |
| PDF trigger | add electrical branch in `generatePDF` route |

## 14. Patrixbourne Avenue — Reference Tender Pack

Primary validation test. Six documents:
- `A1101-KCL-00-00-D-E-2401.pdf` — Ground floor small power (legend embedded)
- `A1101-KCL-00-01-D-E-2411.pdf` — First floor small power
- `A1101-KCL-00-00-D-E-2501.pdf` — Ground floor lighting (A1, B1, C1, D1, G1, H1, J1, PIR — legend embedded)
- `A1101-KCL-00-01-D-E-2511.pdf` — First floor lighting
- `A1101-KCL-XX-XX-L-E-2401.pdf` — Distribution board schedule (26 circuits, cable lengths)
- `A1101-KCL-XX-XX-L-E-2411.pdf` — Equipment schedules (switchgear, accessories, fire alarm)

**Phase 3 validation target:** All symbols matched automatically from embedded legends. HOB, FAP, C, K, EPH, WP, TR all resolved without asking. CD (engineer initials) auto-excluded. Zero questions asked.

---

## 15. Phase 4 — Completed Work

### New files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server/data/electricalLabourRates.ts` | Spon's M&E 2024 UK labour rate lookup. `matchSponsRate(description)` → `{ hoursPerUnit, unit }` or `null`. `PRODUCTIVITY_MULTIPLIERS` constant. Authoritative server copy — imported by `electricalEngine.ts` (Phase 5). |
| `client/src/components/electrical/ElectricalQDS.tsx` | Full QDS component. 8 sections: Line Items, Containment, Cabling, First Points, Plant/Hire, Preliminaries, Labour Summary, Sundries. Spon's rates auto-applied. Labour rate + productivity multiplier in header. Auto-save debounced 1500ms to `qdsSummaryJson`. |
| `client/src/components/electrical/ElectricalDrawingViewer.tsx` | Full-screen marked drawing viewer. PDF rendered via PDF.js. Interactive SVG marker overlay. Three feedback paths all persist to DB (see below). |

### Modified files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `client/src/pages/ElectricalWorkspace.tsx` | QDS tab wired to `ElectricalQDS`. "View" button added per drawing in Takeoff tab. `viewingTakeoffId` state. Viewer modal rendered as sibling via React fragment. `handleViewerExcludedCodesChange` and `handleViewerMarkersUpdated` callbacks. |

### ElectricalQDS — key behaviours

**Stable row key:** `i{inputId}:{code}` — `inputId` never changes even when takeoff record is deleted and recreated on re-analyse. Makes deduplication and edit-preservation reliable.

**Merge on "Update from Takeoff":** Each editable field (`description`, `qty`, `supplyPrice`, `hoursPerUnit`) has a corresponding `*Edited` boolean flag. On rebuild, only unedited fields take fresh takeoff values. Edited fields always survive.

**What survives a QDS rebuild:** `plantHire`, `preliminaries`, `firstPoints`, `sundries`, `labourRate`, `productivityMultiplier` — these live in the root of `ElectricalQDSData` and are never touched by the row merge.

**`qdsSummaryJson` discriminator:** `_type: "electrical"` field distinguishes electrical QDS from general `QuoteDraftData`. Both use the same DB column.

**Section classification:** Description keyword scan routes each row — `cable tray|trunking|conduit|unistrut` → Containment; `cable|swa|t&e|twin.*earth` → Cabling; everything else → Line Items.

**Spon's rates:** Inlined in `ElectricalQDS.tsx` as a client-side mirror of `server/data/electricalLabourRates.ts`. If no rate matches, amber triangle shown — user fills in manually. Both files must be kept in sync when rates are updated.

### ElectricalDrawingViewer — three feedback paths

| Action | How | Persists to DB via |
|---|---|---|
| Chip toggle (grey out symbol type) | Click chip in header bar | `electricalTakeoff.updateExcludedCodes` — immediate, no Save needed |
| Remove individual marker | Click marker on drawing (turns red X) → Save | `electricalTakeoff.updateMarkers` → counts + svgOverlay regenerated |
| Add new marker | Edit Mode → select symbol code chip → click drawing → Save | `electricalTakeoff.updateMarkers` → counts + svgOverlay regenerated |

After `updateMarkers` saves: `refetchTakeoffs()` fires in parent, local `initializedTakeoffs` ref clears for that takeoffId so excluded codes re-initialise from fresh server data.

**"View" button visibility:** Only shown when `takeoff.svgOverlay` exists. Drawings analysed before the svgOverlay feature existed will need a re-analyse first.

---

## 16. Phase 5 — Completed Work

### New files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server/engines/electricalEngine.ts` | Tier 3 sector engine. Two exports: `ElectricalEngine` class (SectorEngine) for `parseDictationSummary`, and `generateElectricalLineItems(qds, startSortIdx)` for `generateDraft`. |

### Modified files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `server/engines/engineRouter.ts` | Added `ElectricalEngine` import. Removed `"electrical"` from `DRAWING_SECTORS`. Added `tradePreset === "electrical"` branch returning `new ElectricalEngine()` before the DrawingEngine check. Updated comments. |
| `server/routers.ts` | Added `generateElectricalLineItems` import. Added `_type === "electrical"` branch at the top of the `qdsSummaryRaw` parse block in `generateDraft` — calls `generateElectricalLineItems(qds, 0)` and skips the general materials/labour/plantHire paths. |

### ElectricalEngine — key behaviours

**parseDictationSummary path (`ElectricalEngine.analyse`):**
- Filters reference-only inputs (legend PDFs) as belt-and-braces
- Parses `ELECTRICAL TAKEOFF — Drawing: ...` blocks from `processedContent`
- Aggregates counts across drawings (same code+description = one row)
- Calls `matchSponsRate(description)` from `electricalLabourRates.ts` for each item
- Returns `materials[]` (one per symbol type, `unitPrice: 0`, `estimated: true`) and one aggregate `labour[]` entry with total hours
- `riskNotes` lists items with no Spon's match so the user knows which QDS rows need manual hours
- Errors are caught and returned as degraded `EngineOutput` — never throws

**generateDraft path (`generateElectricalLineItems`):**
- Supply items: one line item per QDS row — `[CODE] description — supply`, quantity, supplyPrice
- Phase labour: `Phase 1 — First Fix Labour` (40%), `Phase 2 — Second Fix Labour` (40%), `Phase 3 — Testing & Commissioning` (20%) — each as `qty hrs @ labourRate`
- Productivity multiplier applied to total hours before phase split
- Programme note: `Programme: Xw total @ 2 operatives (Phase 1: Xw, Phase 2: Xw, T&C: Xw)` — zero-cost `unit: "note"` line
- First Points, Plant/Hire (with markup and costPrice), Preliminaries, Sundries allowance (% of supply total)
- startSortIdx param so future callers can offset sort order if needed

### Isolation verification
- `ElectricalEngine` imports only `./types` and `../data/electricalLabourRates` — no cross-engine imports
- `engineRouter.ts` electrical branch gated on strict `=== "electrical"` — no other sector reaches it
- `generateDraft` electrical branch gated on `qds._type === "electrical"` — only fires for electrical QDS
- All 25 other sectors: routing unchanged, `generateDraft` unchanged
- `QuoteWorkspace.tsx`, `pdfGenerator.ts`, `ElectricalQDS.tsx`, `ElectricalWorkspace.tsx` — untouched

---

## 18. Phase 6 — Completed Work

### Modified files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `client/src/components/electrical/ElectricalQDS.tsx` | Added `costPrice: number` and `costEdited: boolean` to `ElectricalQDSRow` interface. `buildOrMergeQDS` carries `costPrice` forward (`prev?.costEdited ? prev.costPrice : (prev?.costPrice ?? 0)`) — existing saved QDS without `costPrice` reads safely as `0` via `?? 0`. Added "Buy-in £" column to `ItemTableHeader` (now 12 columns, colSpan updated). Added buy-in input cell in `ItemRow` between Supply £/unit and Supply £ total. `totals` useMemo now accumulates `supplyBuyInTotal` and derives `supplyProfit`, `plantProfit`, `totalProfit`. Grand total card shows internal-only profit rows: supply buy-in, supply profit (green/red + %), plant profit, total profit (bold, green/red + %). All profit rows are QDS-only — never appear in PDF. |
| `server/engines/electricalEngine.ts` | `generateElectricalLineItems`: supply rows now include `costPrice: (row.costPrice ?? 0) > 0 ? String(Math.round((row.costPrice ?? 0) * 100) / 100) : null`. Plant hire already passed `costPrice` correctly — no change. |
| `server/pdfGenerator.ts` | Added electrical branch in `generateQuoteHTML`: `if ((quote as any).tradePreset === "electrical") { html = generateElectricalQuoteHTML(resolvedData); }` — before the existing `isComprehensive` branch. Added `generateElectricalQuoteHTML(data: PDFQuoteData): string` as a new private function at end of file. Template: cover page (navy/teal, logo, project name, TENDER SUBMISSION, client, ref, date), project description, programme table (Phase 1/2/3 with hours and weeks, @ 2 operatives footer), schedule of works (6 sections: Electrical Installation, Containment, Cabling, Labour, Plant & Hire, Preliminaries, Sundries — only non-empty sections rendered), pricing summary (supply/labour/first points/plant/prelims/sundries/subtotal/VAT/total), assumptions & exclusions two-column, terms & conditions, footer. Sell prices only — no cost/margin/profit anywhere in HTML output. |

### Files NOT modified
- `server/routers.ts` — untouched (electrical PDF branch is inside `generateQuoteHTML`, not in the route)
- `server/engines/engineRouter.ts` — untouched
- `QuoteWorkspace.tsx` — untouched (already reads `item.costPrice` correctly for margin display)
- `generateSimpleQuoteHTML` — body byte-for-byte unchanged

### Isolation verification
- `generateSimpleQuoteHTML` body identical to pre-Phase-6 version ✅
- Non-electrical quotes still route through `isComprehensive` / `generateSimpleQuoteHTML` unchanged ✅
- No cost/buy-in/profit data in `generateElectricalQuoteHTML` HTML output ✅
- `costPrice` defaults to `0` in all new QDS rows; existing saved QDS without field reads safely via `?? 0` ✅
- `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` = zero new errors (only pre-existing TS2688 @types stubs) ✅

---

## 19. Phase 7 — Completed Work

### Modified files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `client/src/pages/ElectricalWorkspace.tsx` | Added `ElectricalPDFTab` component. Added `Printer` and `Info` to icon imports. Replaced `PlaceholderTab` for `activeTab === "pdf"` with `<ElectricalPDFTab quoteId={quoteId} quote={quote} lineItems={fullQuote.lineItems} drawings={drawings} />`. Quote tab still uses `PlaceholderTab`. |

### ElectricalPDFTab — key behaviours

- Pre-generation summary card: project name, client, reference, drawing count, line item count, total hours, programme duration, subtotal, VAT (if applicable), total tender price — all derived from already-loaded `fullQuote.lineItems` and `quote` fields, zero extra queries
- Guard: if `lineItems.length === 0`, button is disabled and an amber warning card explains that a draft quote must be generated first (QDS → Quote tab)
- "Generate Tender PDF" button calls `trpc.quotes.generatePDF.useMutation()` — same route, same server function as all other sectors; the electrical branch in `generateQuoteHTML` handles the routing
- On success: `window.open("", "_blank")` → `document.write(html)` → `print()` after 250ms delay — identical pattern to `QuoteWorkspace.tsx`
- On popup blocked: `toast.error("Please allow popups...")`
- On server error: `toast.error` + console log

### Files NOT modified
- `server/routers.ts` — untouched
- `server/pdfGenerator.ts` — untouched (Phase 6 already complete)
- `server/engines/electricalEngine.ts` — untouched
- `server/engines/engineRouter.ts` — untouched
- `QuoteWorkspace.tsx` — untouched
- All non-electrical components — untouched

### Isolation verification
- `QuoteWorkspace.tsx` untouched ✅
- `routers.ts` untouched ✅
- No new tRPC routes — uses existing `quotes.generatePDF` ✅
- `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` = zero new errors ✅

---

| `client/src/pages/ElectricalWorkspace.tsx` | Added `Input` import from `@/components/ui/input`. Added `Sparkles`, `Trash2`, `Plus` to lucide imports. Replaced `PlaceholderTab` for `activeTab === "quote"` with `<ElectricalQuoteTab>`. Added `ElectricalQuoteTab` component. |

### ElectricalQuoteTab — key behaviours

**Empty state:** "Generate Draft from QDS" button calls `trpc.ai.generateDraft` — which for electrical reads `qdsSummaryJson._type === "electrical"` and runs `generateElectricalLineItems`. No AI reinterpretation of confirmed QDS rows.

**Confirm on regenerate:** if line items already exist, `window.confirm` before replacing — same guard as `QuoteWorkspace`.

**Line item grouping:** Items classified into 9 sections using the same rules as `pdfGenerator.ts`: Supply, Containment, Cabling, Labour, Programme (note rows), First Points, Plant & Hire, Preliminaries, Sundries. Sections with no items are hidden.

**Programme note rows** (`unit === "note"`): rendered as full-width italic rows — no qty/rate/total columns.

**Inline editing:** click any cell (description, qty, unit, rate) to edit inline. Enter or blur to save via `trpc.lineItems.update`. Escape to cancel. Same pattern as `QuoteWorkspace`.

**Margin column** (internal only, never in PDF): reads `item.costPrice` stored on the line item (written by `generateElectricalLineItems` from QDS buy-in). Shows `£X.XX (Y%)` in green/red. No catalog fallback needed — electrical always stores `costPrice` directly.

**Totals card:** Supply, Containment, Cabling, Labour, First Points, Plant & Hire, Prelims, Sundries (only non-zero lines shown), then Subtotal + VAT + Total tender price.

**Delete:** per-row trash icon on hover, calls `trpc.lineItems.delete`.

**Toolbar:** "Regenerate from QDS" button + line item count. Column header labels aligned to the grid.

## 22. Phase 9 — Remaining Items

The electrical workspace is now feature-complete end-to-end:
- Inputs ✅ — drawings, legend, scope
- Takeoff ✅ — symbol review table, drawing viewer, include/exclude toggles
- QDS ✅ — Spon's rates, buy-in margin, plant hire, prelims, sundries
- Quote ✅ — line items grouped by section, inline edit, margin display, totals
- PDF ✅ — tender submission document

Remaining open items (separate track):
- **3 known bugs (general workspace):** legend PDFs triggering takeoff, `generateDraft` not skipping reference-only inputs, unknown symbols dropped
- **Sector engine modularisation** — Phases 1–5 of the roadmap docx

### Overview

Three things to build, in this order:

1. **Add `costPrice` to `ElectricalQDSRow`** — buy-in column in QDS table, preserved across rebuilds, flows through to generated line items so `QuoteWorkspace.tsx` shows margin exactly as all other sectors do
2. **Pass `costPrice` through `generateElectricalLineItems`** — so `QuoteWorkspace.tsx` reads it from the line item record and shows per-row and total margin (zero extra work on the quote display side — already works this way for all sectors)
3. **`generateElectricalQuoteHTML`** — new PDF function; renders sell prices only, never cost/margin

---

### How the rest of the app does margin (match this exactly)

**Pattern in `QuoteWorkspace.tsx`:**
- Each line item record has a `costPrice` column (in `drizzle/schema.ts` — added 26 Mar 2026)
- Per-row margin cell reads `item.costPrice`; calculates `(rate − costPrice) × qty`; shown as `£X.XX (Y%)`
- `resolveCostPrice()` helper: reads `item.costPrice` first, falls back to catalog match only if null
- Margin summary bar: one colour-coded row per `pricingType` — `standard` = green, `monthly` = teal, `annual` = amber, `optional` = purple; shows `£revenue − £cost = £margin (Y%)`
- **No changes needed to `QuoteWorkspace.tsx`** — it already reads `item.costPrice` correctly. Just pass `costPrice` through from the QDS row and it works.

---

### Concern A — Exact file changes

**`client/src/components/electrical/ElectricalQDS.tsx`:**

1. Add to `ElectricalQDSRow` interface (after `supplyEdited`):
```typescript
costPrice: number;    // £ per unit buy-in
costEdited: boolean;
```

2. Add defaults in `buildRow()` (alongside `supplyPrice: 0, supplyEdited: false`):
```typescript
costPrice: prev?.costEdited ? prev.costPrice : 0,
costEdited: false,
```
Also add `?? 0` fallback when reading from saved JSON: `costPrice: row.costPrice ?? 0` — so existing saved QDS data without `costPrice` deserialises without error.

3. Add "Buy-in £" column to the row table — between supply price and hours columns. Input style identical to `supplyPrice` input. `onChange` sets `{ costPrice: numInput(e.target.value), costEdited: true }`.

4. Update `totals` useMemo — add inside the `for (const r of rows)` loop:
```typescript
let supplyBuyInTotal = 0;
// inside loop:
supplyBuyInTotal += r.costPrice * r.qty;
```
After the loop, derive:
```typescript
const supplyProfit = supplyTotal - supplyBuyInTotal;
const plantProfit  = plantSell - plantBuyIn;  // plantBuyIn/plantSell already calculated
const totalProfit  = supplyProfit + plantProfit;
```
Return `supplyBuyInTotal`, `supplyProfit`, `plantProfit`, `totalProfit` from the useMemo.

5. Add profit display to the grand total card — internal only, never in PDF:
- "Supply buy-in: £X.XX" (grey label)
- "Supply profit: £X.XX (Y%)" — green if positive, red if negative
- "Plant profit: £X.XX" — only rendered if `plantHire.length > 0`
- **"Total profit: £X.XX (Y%)"** — bold, green/red

---

**`server/engines/electricalEngine.ts` — `generateElectricalLineItems`:**

For supply rows, add `costPrice` field:
```typescript
costPrice: (row.costPrice ?? 0) > 0 ? String(Math.round((row.costPrice ?? 0) * 100) / 100) : null,
```
Plant hire already passes `costPrice` correctly from Phase 5 — no change needed.

---

### Concern B — PDF must never show cost/profit

`generateElectricalQuoteHTML` outputs sell prices and totals only:
- No margin column, no buy-in column, no profit row, no cost price anywhere in the HTML
- `costPrice` field on line items is used by `QuoteWorkspace.tsx` for the margin display — the PDF function ignores it entirely

---

### Phase 6 — PDF function spec

**New function:** `generateElectricalQuoteHTML(quoteData: FullQuoteData): Promise<string>`
Add to `server/pdfGenerator.ts` — add-only, never modify `generateSimpleQuoteHTML`.

`FullQuoteData` is already the type returned by `getFullQuoteData` and used by `generateSimpleQuoteHTML` — same shape, same import, no new DB queries needed.

**Route change in `server/routers.ts`** — add before the existing `generateSimpleQuoteHTML` call inside `quotes.generatePDF`:
```typescript
if ((quote as any).tradePreset === "electrical") {
  html = await generateElectricalQuoteHTML(fullQuoteData);
} else {
  html = await generateSimpleQuoteHTML(fullQuoteData);  // unchanged
}
```

**Template sections (sell prices only):**

1. **Cover page** — company logo, project name, "TENDER SUBMISSION", date, quote reference. Navy (`#1a2b4a`) header band, teal (`#0d9488`) accent.

2. **Project scope** — `quote.description` paragraph.

3. **Programme table** — derived from phase labour line items:
   | Phase | Scope | Hours | Weeks |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Phase 1 — First Fix | Containment, back boxes, cabling | Xhrs | Xw |
   | Phase 2 — Second Fix | Fittings, accessories, devices | Xhrs | Xw |
   | Phase 3 — T&C | EIC, EICR, client handover | Xhrs | Xw |
   Footer note: `@ 2 operatives, 40 hrs/week`

4. **Schedule of Works** — line items grouped under section headings:
   - Electrical Installation (supply rows, not containment/cabling)
   - Containment (description ends with `— containment`)
   - Cabling (description ends with `— cabling`)
   - Labour (description starts with `Phase 1`, `Phase 2`, `Phase 3`)
   - Plant & Hire (description contains `day(s)` or `week(s)`)
   - Preliminaries (everything else with rate > 0)

   Each row: Description | Qty | Unit | Rate (£) | Total (£)
   Programme note rows (`unit === "note"`): full-width italic, no amounts columns.

5. **Pricing Summary:**
   ```
   Supply Total          £X,XXX.XX
   Labour Total          £X,XXX.00
   First Points          £X,XXX.00   (omit if £0)
   Plant & Hire          £X,XXX.00   (omit if £0)
   Preliminaries         £X,XXX.00   (omit if £0)
   Sundries              £X,XXX.00   (omit if £0)
   ─────────────────────────────────
   Subtotal              £X,XXX.00
   VAT (20%)             £X,XXX.00   (omit if quote.taxRate === 0)
   ─────────────────────────────────
   TOTAL TENDER PRICE    £X,XXX.00
   ```

6. **Assumptions & Exclusions** — bullet lists from `quote.assumptions` / `quote.exclusions`.

7. **Terms & Conditions** — `quote.terms` full text.

8. **Footer** — company name, address, contact email/phone.

### How to identify line item types from the `lineItems` array

All set by `generateElectricalLineItems` (Phase 5):

| Type | Identify by |
|---|---|
| Supply — line items | not containment/cabling, not phase labour, not note, not circuit, not sundries, not prelim pattern |
| Supply — containment | description ends with `— containment` |
| Supply — cabling | description ends with `— cabling` |
| Phase labour | description starts with `"Phase 1"`, `"Phase 2"`, or `"Phase 3"` |
| Programme note | `unit === "note"` |
| First Points | `unit === "circuit"` |
| Plant/Hire | description contains `" day(s)"` OR `" week(s)"` |
| Sundries | description starts with `"Sundries allowance"` |
| Preliminaries | everything else with `rate > 0` |

---

### Files to change — Phase 6

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `client/src/components/electrical/ElectricalQDS.tsx` | Add `costPrice` + `costEdited` to `ElectricalQDSRow`; add buy-in input column; add profit lines to grand total card |
| `server/engines/electricalEngine.ts` | Pass `costPrice` on supply rows in `generateElectricalLineItems` |
| `server/pdfGenerator.ts` | Add `generateElectricalQuoteHTML` — new function, sell prices only |
| `server/routers.ts` | Add electrical branch in `quotes.generatePDF` — add only |

**Must NOT be modified:** `QuoteWorkspace.tsx`, `generateSimpleQuoteHTML`, `generalEngine.ts`, `drawingEngine.ts`, `engineRouter.ts`, any non-electrical component.

---

### Isolation checklist for Phase 6

Before delivery, verify:
- [ ] `generateSimpleQuoteHTML` body byte-for-byte unchanged
- [ ] `generatePDF` route: non-electrical quotes still hit existing path unchanged
- [ ] No `costPrice`, margin, or profit appears anywhere in the HTML/PDF output
- [ ] `ElectricalQDS.tsx` change is additive — `costPrice` defaults to `0`; existing saved QDS without `costPrice` reads as `0` via `?? 0` fallback; no data loss
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` = zero new errors
